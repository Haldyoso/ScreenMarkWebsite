/**
 * Copies the application's CHANGELOG.md into content/ so the /changelog pages
 * can read it at build time.
 *
 * The site and the app are separate repositories and the deploy workflow only
 * checks out this one, so a build-time path into ../ScreenMark works locally
 * and breaks in CI. Vendoring keeps the build hermetic; this script is the
 * thing that has to be re-run when the app cuts a release.
 *
 *     npm run sync:changelog                    # ../ScreenMark/CHANGELOG.md
 *     npm run sync:changelog -- D:\src\ScreenMark
 *
 * The argument is the app repo's root, not the file.
