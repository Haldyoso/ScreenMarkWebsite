/**
 * Light/dark switch for the token set that already existed in globals.css but
 * had no way to be turned on.
 *
 * Deliberately stateless. React never learns the current theme, because the
 * pre-paint script in DocumentShell has already written `data-theme` onto
 * <html> by the time hydration runs — holding a copy in useState would mean
 * either a wrong first render or a flash while an effect corrects it. Instead
 * both icons and both labels ship in the markup and CSS shows the pair that
 * matches `data-theme`, so the server HTML is correct for either theme and
 * there is nothing to reconcile.
