 * - `data-js` gates the scroll-reveal CSS. Only once it flips to "on" does
 *   anything get hidden, so a JS-less client sees the whole page and a JS
 *   client never watches content appear and then vanish.
 * - `data-theme` is read back from localStorage. Applying it here rather than
 *   in an effect avoids painting the dark default and then repainting light.
 *   Absent a stored choice nothing is set and the dark tokens on :root stand,
 *   which keeps the brand default and the screenshots in agreement.
