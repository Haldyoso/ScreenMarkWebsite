# ScreenMark — official website

Marketing site for **ScreenMark**, the portable Windows screen-annotation app whose
annotations stay fully editable. One conversion goal: download the public trial EXE.
Published in English, Slovak and German.

The handoff bundle below still says "ScreenMarkPro" throughout — that was the working name
during design. The shipped product and this site are **ScreenMark**; the bundle is kept
verbatim as the original deliverable.

Built to the spec in
[`ScreenMark UX redesign/design_handoff_screenmarkpro_website/README.md`](<ScreenMark UX redesign/design_handoff_screenmarkpro_website/README.md>).

## Stack

Next.js 15 (App Router) · React 19 · TypeScript (strict) · Tailwind CSS 4 ·
Framer Motion · Radix primitives (shadcn-style) · lucide-react · marked (build-time only).

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

Two maintenance scripts, neither part of the build:

```bash
npm run sync:changelog -- ../ScreenMark   # refresh content/CHANGELOG.md from the app repo
npm run optimize:screenshots              # convert any new PNG in public/screenshots to WebP
```

Everything is a Server Component except the interactive islands: `Navbar`,
`ThemeToggle`, `FeatureShowcase`, `Gallery`, `Lightbox` (dynamically imported) and the
FAQ `Accordion`.

## Languages

English is the default and lives at the site root; Slovak and German hang off `/sk` and
`/de`. `output: "export"` rules out middleware, so a language-negotiating `/` could only
be a client-side redirect — an extra round trip on the most common entry point. Serving
the default language directly avoids that and avoids an `/en` duplicate of `/`.

Each locale is its own **route group with its own root layout**, which is the only way
`<html lang>` can be a server-rendered attribute per language. Moving between groups
forces a full page load; for a language switch that is the correct behaviour, not a cost.

### Adding or changing copy

Copy lives in `lib/content/{en,sk,de}.ts`, all three typed as `Copy` from
[`types/index.ts`](types/index.ts). **Change English first** — the shared interface then
makes the other two fail `npm run typecheck` until they catch up, so a missing German
string is a build error rather than an English sentence that survives into production.

What deliberately does **not** live in the locale files: icons, screenshot file names,
keyboard keys and the comparison matrix's yes/no values. Those are facts about the
product, not language, and live once in
[`lib/content/shared.ts`](lib/content/shared.ts). Triplicating them would let a wrong
`false` in the comparison table survive in one language after being fixed in another.

Each locale emits `<link rel="alternate" hreflang>` for all three plus `x-default`, and
the sitemap repeats the full alternate set on every URL — an alternate group is only
trusted when every member points back at every other.

## Design tokens

All colors, radii, shadows, easings and fonts are `@theme` tokens in
[`app/globals.css`](app/globals.css) — no hard-coded hex outside that file.

The one mapping worth memorizing: the spec's `text.primary` / `text.secondary` /
`text.disabled` are the utilities `text-fg` / `text-fg-muted` / `text-fg-subtle`.

### Themes

Dark is the brand default and the theme every screenshot was captured in. The light token
set applies when `:root` carries `data-theme="light"`, which the navbar toggle writes and
an inline script in `DocumentShell` replays from `localStorage` before first paint.

**With nothing stored, no attribute is set and dark stands.** `prefers-color-scheme` is
deliberately not consulted: honouring it would flip a large share of visitors to a light
page whose screenshots are all dark, which is a design decision rather than a fix.

The toggle holds no React state. Both icons and both labels ship in the markup and CSS
picks the pair matching `data-theme` (`.theme-when-dark` / `.theme-when-light`), so the
server HTML is correct for either theme and there is nothing to reconcile at hydration.

Anything that inverts with the theme needs a token, not a literal — `--color-nav-scrim`
and `--color-hatch-a/b` exist because a hard-coded dark navbar scrim and a hard-coded
dark hatch both broke the light theme, the second by putting near-black body copy on a
near-black panel.

## Screenshots

`public/screenshots/` holds twelve real captures of ScreenMark annotating an engineering
drawing — not mock-ups. Each is cropped from a full 1920×1080 capture of the app running
over the drawing held open behind it, so what the site shows is what the product draws.

Every entry in the locale files pairs the file with its `alt`, and the `alt` describes
**that specific image**, not the feature in the abstract. If you re-shoot a capture and
the contents change — a different angle reading, a different stamp — change the `alt` in
**all three locales** in the same commit or it quietly starts lying to screen readers.

```ts
// lib/content/shared.ts — the file, without an extension
"cad-measurement": "/screenshots/measurement",

// lib/content/en.ts — what that specific image shows
alt: "An angle measured across two bolt holes reading 35.2° …",
```

Three things to keep in mind when replacing one:

- **Format.** The captures ship as **WebP**, ~a third of the PNG bytes for identical
  linework. Drop the PNG in and run `npm run optimize:screenshots`, which converts and
  deletes the original. Paths in `shared.ts` carry no extension —
  [`components/ui/screenshot.tsx`](components/ui/screenshot.tsx) appends it, so switching
  format later is one constant.
- **Size.** Image optimization is off (see Deployment), so the browser downloads exactly
  what you commit. The hero renders ~1200 px wide at 16:9; showcase and gallery slots are
  16:10. Match those ratios or `object-cover` will crop the sides off.
- **`basePath` is applied in `screenshot.tsx`, not in the data.** See Deployment for why
  it has to be.

## Changelog page

`/changelog` (and its two translations) renders `content/CHANGELOG.md`, a **vendored copy**
of the application repository's own file. Vendored because the two live in separate
repositories and the deploy workflow checks out only this one — a build-time path into
`../ScreenMark` works locally and fails in CI. Refresh it with `npm run sync:changelog`.

Only the most recent `RELEASE_LIMIT` (20) entries render. The app's changelog is a
development log — 106 entries by 0.9.9.61 — and all of them produced a 557 kB page.

The entries are reproduced verbatim, so they are in Slovak on all three pages; the
framing copy says so rather than pretending otherwise. `marked` runs at build time on a
file in this repository, never ships to the browser, and its output is as trusted as the
JSX around it.

## Comparison table

Every competitor cell is transcribed from vendor documentation, with the sources and
dates recorded in the comment above `compareValues` in
[`lib/content/shared.ts`](lib/content/shared.ts). **Check the source before changing a
value**, and update that comment in the same commit.

A 2026-08-11 pass against the vendors' own pages corrected three claims that were wrong
in ScreenMark's favour: Greenshot and ShareX both ship portable ZIP builds (they were
marked installer-only), Greenshot's `.greenshot` format does keep elements editable for
later (it was marked a flat No), and ShareX's offline row carried an "opt-out" note that
nothing in its documentation supports.

The magnifier row, which ScreenMark loses to Pointofix, stays in on purpose. A table the
incumbent loses 10–0 reads as a strawman.

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` runs [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml):
lint → typecheck → `next build` → publish `out/` to GitHub Pages. Live at
**https://haldyoso.github.io/ScreenMarkWebsite/**.

Pages is a static file host with no Node process, which forces four things:

- `output: "export"` in [`next.config.ts`](next.config.ts). Every metadata route
  (`manifest`, `robots`, `sitemap`, the OG images) needs `export const dynamic =
  "force-static"` or the build fails on it — one at a time, so expect to hit them in turn.
- **`basePath`** — project sites are served from `/<repo>`, not the root. It lives in
  [`lib/site.ts`](lib/site.ts) so the config and the app share one value. Next rewrites
  `<Link>` and the build output automatically. Two places it does **not** reach, both
  prefixed by hand:
  - strings inside the manifest JSON body ([`app/manifest.ts`](app/manifest.ts)) — plain
    data as far as Next is concerned;
  - `next/image` **when `images.unoptimized` is set**. The prefix is normally applied by
    the loader, and turning optimization off short-circuits exactly that loader, so the
    tag ships the bare `src` and every capture 404s on a project site. Handled once in
    [`components/ui/screenshot.tsx`](components/ui/screenshot.tsx).
- **`images.unoptimized: true`** — the default loader resizes on request and there is no
  server to do it.
- **No security headers.** The `headers()` block was removed rather than left to be
  silently dropped: Pages sends a fixed header set and cannot add to it. Restore it if
  this ever moves to a host that runs Node.

The three localized OG cards are generated into `public/` by
`tools/generate-og-images.mjs` before every production build. The generator uses bundled
Noto Sans fonts and Sharp, so output is deterministic and Pages serves real `.png` files
with the correct content type instead of the extensionless file produced by Next's image
convention.

`robots.txt` is emitted at `/ScreenMarkWebsite/robots.txt`, which crawlers ignore; only a
root-domain one counts. It costs nothing and starts working the day this gets a real
domain.

## Release and launch notes

- The only public download is the time-limited `0.9.9.96` trial EXE. Its version,
  expiry date, byte size and SHA-256 live together in `lib/site.ts`; the same data feeds
  the CTA and JSON-LD.
- The application repository is private, so public GitHub and issue links target this
  website repository. Footer entries without a public destination are omitted.
- The app repository still has no `LICENSE` file and its commercial model is undecided.
  The site therefore makes no MIT claim and renders no licence link until that decision is
  backed by a published document. Revisit the JSON-LD offer if access stops being free.

## Accessibility & motion

One `h1`, ordered headings, semantic landmarks. Each locale's `<html lang>` is
server-rendered, and the language switcher's links carry `hreflang` and `lang` so a screen
reader pronounces "Slovenčina" in Slovak rather than with the page's voice.

The lightbox traps focus, restores it to the card that opened it, and supports Esc and
←/→ (wrapping). Comparison-table status is never color-only — every ✓/— carries a visually
hidden "Yes"/"No" in the page's own language, and qualifying notes are translated strings
rather than English fragments. All motion honors `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Scroll reveals are IntersectionObserver-driven, with the hidden state scoped to
`html[data-js="on"]` (set by the same inline script that applies the theme, before first
paint). A Framer Motion `initial` would instead ship `opacity: 0` in the server HTML,
blanking the page for no-JS clients and holding LCP until hydration.
