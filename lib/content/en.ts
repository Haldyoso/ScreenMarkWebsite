      install: {
        question: "Do I need to install anything?",
        answer:
          "No. ScreenMark is a portable application — unzip the folder and run the executable. It needs no installer, no administrator rights and no registry changes, so it works fine on locked-down corporate machines and from a USB stick.",
      },
      editable: {
        question: "What does “everything stays editable” actually mean?",
        answer:
          "Every mark you make is a vector object, not baked-in pixels. You can reselect any arrow, shape, text or measurement later to move, resize, rotate, recolor, regroup or delete it — just like objects in PowerPoint or Illustrator. Your work is only flattened when you export to an image.",
      },
      internet: {
        question: "Does it send any data to the internet?",
        answer:
          "Never. The app runs completely offline with no account, no cloud sync and no telemetry. Your screenshots and annotations stay on your machine.",
      },
      monitors: {
        question: "Does it work across multiple monitors?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Freeze mode captures every monitor independently, and the floating toolbar follows your cursor between screens. Mixed-DPI multi-monitor setups are supported.",
      },
      reopen: {
        question: "Can I re-open and keep editing an annotation later?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Save your work as a .smpj project — readable JSON — to keep every object editable, or export a PNG/JPG for sharing. Autosave also keeps a rolling snapshot so you can recover after a crash.",
      },
      windows: {
        question: "Which Windows versions are supported?",
