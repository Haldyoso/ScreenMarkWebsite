/**
 * The comparison matrix. Values only — every label and qualifying note is
 * translated copy and lives in the locale files.
 *
 * Sourced, not remembered. Each competitor column is transcribed from the
 * vendor's own documentation, checked 2026-08-11:
 *
 * - Pointofix — pointofix.de/bedienung.php. A paint-over annotator: pen, lines,
 *   arrows, rectangles, ellipses, text, ticks and crosses, an eraser that
 *   "partially deletes", and saving to "JPG, PNG oder BMP". No object
 *   re-selection, no layers, no measurement, no project format. It does ship a
 *   "Lupe mit 200 % und 400 % Vergrößerung" plus a stepwise zoom "mit bis zu
 *   10-facher Vergrößerung", which ScreenMark's own README still lists as
 *   planned — hence the one row ScreenMark loses. A table the incumbent loses
 *   10–0 reads as a strawman; this one is real.
 *
 * - Snipping Tool — Microsoft's and elevenforum's feature write-ups. Shapes can
 *   be resized, moved and recoloured, but "once the shape is deselected, it
 *   will merge with your image", so editing is transient. Its ruler and
 *   protractor are drawing guides for straight lines and arcs, not measurement
 *   read-outs, which is why the measurement row stays a No.
 *
 * - Greenshot — getgreenshot.org/downloads + the .greenshot format discussion.
 *   Elements stay editable for the editor session, and the .greenshot format
 *   persists them for later editing; only the flattened PNG bakes them in. A
 *   ZIP distribution exists in the version history alongside the installer.
 *
 * - ShareX — getsharex.com. The download page lists "Portable" next to "Setup".
 *   Its editor keeps annotation objects live for the session. The site states a
 *   "Privacy first" position and there is no documented telemetry — an earlier
 *   revision of this table marked its offline row "opt-out", which nothing
 *   supports, so it is a plain Yes.
